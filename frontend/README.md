- `src`: Main project source dir
  - `app`: Main application source dir
    - `page`: Directory connected with single page (logic + presentation)
    - `components`: Components used in pages, feature components
    - `model`: Data classes used in project
    - `main`: Application definitions, app component
    - `services`: Injectable services and providers

## Setting up environment

### Requirements:

- NodeJS 6.10+ LTS [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- Angular CLI 1.2.7   
`npm install -g @angular/cli@1.4.7` (It will install CLI tool globally in 1.2.7 version.)

### Running project

- Clone this repository
- Go to root directory of repository (where `package.json` is located) and run `npm install`.  
 All of the project dependencies should fetched via npm. (this can take a while...)

- Run `ng serve --env=local` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. 

- In case you want to use custom host and port, use `--host` and `--port` flags.  
 Example: `ng serve --configuration=local --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4201`   
 The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Testing

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
